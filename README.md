# Financial Control App - JS

## Aplication
The idea of this app is to allow the user to record their expenses. This application was built using the browser's local storage feature, so that the entered data remains stored in the browserâ€™s database, allowing users to add and review the data they have entered.

### How to use:
* Click the link below and add your expenses. 
* On the 'Consult' page, you can review all your expenses.
* By entering data in the available fields and clicking the search button, you can filter your expenses according to the entered information.
* If you wish to remove an expense from the list, just click the red button corresponding to the expense.
